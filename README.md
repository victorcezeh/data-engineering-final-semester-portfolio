## About
In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects and assessments that demonstrate my proficiency in various aspects of data engineering. Each project is designed to challenge and enhance my skills, covering topics such as data pipelines, ETL processes, Cloud, big data technologies, and more.


## Projects
- **Project 1**: [postgres_docker_init](https://github.com/victorcezeh/data-engineering-final-semester-portfolio/tree/main/postgres_docker_init) - This project sets up and tests PostgreSQL infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose. It involves creating a Dockerized PostgreSQL server, loading data from a CSV file, and writing Python scripts to interact with the database. Includes detailed README documentation.
- **Project 2**: [py_gcs_bq](https://github.com/victorcezeh/data-engineering-final-semester-portfolio/blob/main/py_gcs_bq/config.py) - This Python project enables seamless interaction with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and BigQuery. It supports loading CSV files from a local machine into BigQuery and fetching API data to store in GCS, which is then loaded into BigQuery. The code is designed to be idempotent, reusable, and well-documented, with secrets managed via a .env file and constants through config.py. Includes detailed README documentation.
